Earlier this month, in an interview with TNT Sports, Fury didn't mince words about his strategy for the rematch, as quoted by Talksport, stating: "I'm going to go in there [in] destroy mode. Last time I went to box him and I was being cautious", reports the Mirror.

He also claimed: "I was boxing the head right off him, let's talk facts. Anyone can get caught as we've seen in a lot of these heavyweight fights. But this time I'm not going for a points decision. I'm going to knock a mother*****r out."
